Assets guide

- Put your 3D model in: assets/models/ (prefer .glb or .gltf)
- Put your custom font files in: assets/fonts/ (prefer .woff2; you can include .woff as fallback)
- Optional textures in: assets/textures/
- Optional HDRI environment maps in: assets/hdris/

Recommended formats
- 3D: .glb (binary glTF) is best for the web. If you only have .fbx/.obj/.blend, we can convert to .glb.
- Fonts: .woff2 (smallest/best), optionally .woff. We can also use .ttf/.otf if needed.

Naming tips
- Model file: YourModel.glb
- Font file(s): YourFont-Regular.woff2, YourFont-Bold.woff2 (or a single variable font YourFontVF.woff2)

After you add files, let me know:
- The model filename you added in assets/models/
- The font family name to show on the site (+ weights/styles if multiple files)
- Any preferred colors or a link to a brand palette
- Desired interactions (orbit, auto-rotate, click-to-focus, etc.)
